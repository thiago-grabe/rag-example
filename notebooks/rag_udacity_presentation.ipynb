    "# Project Overview: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that combines information retrieval with natural language generation. By integrating a vector database with a generative language model, RAG enhances the contextual relevance and accuracy of generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Does This Project Use RAG?\n",
    "This project demonstrates the power of RAG by:\n",
    "1. Storing car descriptions as vector embeddings in a vector database (ChromaDB).\n",
    "2. Querying the database to retrieve the most relevant information based on user queries.\n",
    "3. Generating enriched and personalized responses using GPT-3.5.\n",
    "4. Enhancing engagement by visualizing results with realistic AI-generated images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Vector Database Integration**: Efficient storage and retrieval of car metadata.\n",
    "- **LLM-Driven Enrichment**: Personalized and human-like messages for recommendations.\n",
    "- **Image Generation**: Realistic car images for an engaging user experience.\n",
    "- **Retry Mechanism**: Robust reranking ensures reliable and context-aware outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reranking is a critical component in ensuring the most relevant results are presented to users. This step introduces a robust retry mechanism that enhances the reliability of the reranking process when utilizing GPT-3.5 for scoring relevance. The retry mechanism ensures consistent results even in cases where API calls fail due to network or token errors.\n",

    "3. **Streamlined Results**: Logs skipped entries gracefully to maintain overall system performance and user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reranking Workflow\n",
    "- Query results from ChromaDB are passed to GPT-3.5 for relevance scoring.\n",
    "- If an error occurs during a GPT call, the retry mechanism attempts up to three calls.\n",
    "- Results with successful scores are combined with vector similarity scores to calculate a weighted ranking.\n",
    "- Entries that fail after retries are logged and skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Highlights\n",
    "- **Retry Logic**: Built into the `rerank_gpt_call` function, ensuring a seamless fallback for errors.\n",
    "- **Combined Scoring**: Weighted scores from GPT relevance and vector similarity ensure robust ranking.\n",
    "- **Error Logging**: Keeps track of skipped results, enabling post-analysis for improvements.\n",
